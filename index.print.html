                            <p>Wimdu is one of the big international online platforms for the appartment rental. Still growing rapidly Wimdu has great prospects.</p>

                            <h6>About my activities:</h6>
                            <p>I have great skills and work experience in software development as well as experience in international level (there are projects in Russia and the USA). Lack of highly qualified professionals in this field in Germany is a guarantee of my financial stability.</p>
				<h6>About my family:</h6>
				<p>My family consists of my wife and me. My wife is software developer too, and she's looking for a job right now.</p>
				<h6>About situation with accommodation:</h6>
                            <p>Here in Berlin we are looking for a 2 room apartment and a stable payment of the rental period. Now we live in a furnished short-time apartment. The rental contract will end this month. And we're very interested to quickly find an apartment.</p>
